# 🎯 Current APK Build Status

## ✅ Progress Made

- **Gradle Build System**: Working perfectly (Java 11, Gradle 7.6.3)
- **Android SDK**: Automatically downloading and installing components
- **Platform Tools**: Successfully downloaded and extracted
- **Build Process**: Reached execution phase (71 tasks executed)

## ⚠️ Current Issue

The build failed after 2m 52s during execution. Common causes:

### Likely Issues:

1. **Missing SDK Components**: Build tools or specific platform version
2. **License Acceptance**: Some SDK licenses may need manual acceptance
3. **Memory/Resources**: Build process may need more memory
4. **Dependencies**: Some Android dependencies may be incompatible

## 🔧 Quick Solutions

### Solution 1: Accept All SDK Licenses

```powershell
# If we can get sdkmanager working:
.\cmdline-tools\latest\bin\sdkmanager.bat --licenses
```

### Solution 2: Use Android Studio (Recommended)

1. Open Android Studio manually
2. File → Open → Select `android` folder
3. Let Android Studio install missing components
4. Build → Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) → Build APK(s)

### Solution 3: Online Build Service

- Use Ionic AppFlow or GitHub Actions
- No local SDK setup needed
- Professional build environment

### Solution 4: Try Different Build Target

```powershell
# Try building with less strict requirements:
.\gradlew assembleDebug --no-daemon --stacktrace
```

## 🚀 Recommended Next Step

**Try Android Studio method:**

2. Open the `android` folder as a project
3. Wait for Gradle sync
4. Install any missing components it suggests
